# DRL
Deep Reinforcement Learning basic approaches: DQN, Experience Replay Memory (ERM), Prioritized Experience Replay Memory (SumTree)

* memory: contains ERM and PERM realizations
* dqn: realization of DQN from https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf 
* models: FCNN and CNN for vector state space representation
